# Coding Conventions & Practices

### Naming Scheme

* Variable and method names: `lowerCamelCase`
* Constants: `CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
* Meaningful variable and method names
* Class/Interface names: `UpperCamelCase`
* No underscores for instance fields, use: `this.fieldName`

### Version Control

* Only commit working code
* Each commit relates to a single ticket from ZenHub
* Create a new branch for working on each ticket
* Branch names: **OP-{ticket_number}**
* Commit messages: **{branch_name} commit message**
* Commit often
* Pull requests **must** be reviewed by another team member before being merged

### Comments

* Well documented classes, interfaces, and public methods (JavaDoc)
* Use single line comments sparingly
* Use single/multi-line comments (not JavaDoc) for code explanations and private methods
