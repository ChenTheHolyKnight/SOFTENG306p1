# SoftEng306Project1

## Project Description
This project is about using artificial intelligence and parallel processing power to solve a difficult
scheduling problem. It is about Speed! In this project of the SoftEng306 design course your client is
the leader of a Parallel Computing Centre, who needs you to solve a difficult scheduling problem for
his parallel computer systems. This client happens to be Oliver Sinnen. The project is well defined
and scoped, but the particular challenge of this project are the (possibly) contradicting objectives:
developing a solution with a Software Engineering approach and design while having a very fast
execution speed. At the end of the project your solutions will compete against each other in a speed
comparison. Your team might choose to contribute the solution to the PARC lab for their work.

## CLI Usage
```
Usage:  java -jar scheduler.jar [path-to-DOT-file] [Number-of-processors] [-options]

where options include:
    -p <numCores>       Choose the number of computer cores to run the algorithm on,
                        where <numCores> is the number of cores. 
                        (default is 1)
  
    -v                  Shows a visualization of the algorithm while it is running.
                        (may slow down performance)
  
    -o <name>           Sets output name of the output DOT file, where <name> is the 
                        name of the output file.
                        (default is "[path-to-DOT-file]-output.Dot"
```
